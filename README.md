# Voice-Based-Cognitive-Decline-Pattern-Detection
This project detects early signs of cognitive decline by analyzing speech recordings. It uses Wav2Vec2 for transcription and extracts features like hesitations, speech rate, and pitch variability. Unsupervised models (Isolation Forest, K-Means) assess risk levels. The full pipeline is deployed as a user-friendly Streamlit web application.
